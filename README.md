# Multiple_Disease_Prediction_System

This project offers a user-friendly interface for medical professionals to predict diseases such as pneumonia, malaria, and brain tumors using medical images. The interface allows users to upload images of cells, X-rays, or MRI scans, and the system employs deep learning models to analyze these images and provide predictions on the presence or absence of diseases.

### Features:
- Multi-disease Prediction: The interface supports the prediction of three diseases: malaria, pneumonia, and brain tumors, each with its own specialized deep learning model.
- User Authentication: Implemented a simple login system to restrict access to authorized users, ensuring data security and privacy.
- Interactive Interface: Utilized Streamlit to create an interactive and intuitive user interface, enabling easy navigation and seamless image upload.
- Real-time Prediction: Upon image upload, the system performs real-time analysis and provides immediate feedback on the presence or absence of diseases.
- Model Persistence: The trained deep learning models are loaded into the interface, allowing for quick and efficient predictions without the need for retraining.
